# RLHF-TransferLearning-for-Safety

**Independent AI Research: Sani Jibo**

## Project Overview
This repository focuses on **Transfer Learning** strategies for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), addressing the problem of **safety and alignment drift** when deploying foundational models across different tasks or domains.

The goal is to demonstrate an accelerated process for transferring a trained safety policy (via RLHF/DPO) to a new base model with minimal fine-tuning and data, significantly improving the time-to-safety metric.

### Key Features
* **Safety Policy Transfer:** Conceptual implementation of a transfer learning pipeline for preference models.
* **Drift Mitigation Scaffolding:** Includes methods for rapid auditing and correction of safety policy drift post-deployment.
* **Minimal Data Requirements:** Demonstrates techniques for maximizing the utility of a small, high-quality safety dataset.

## Alignment Mission
This code supports a core component of the broader **Alignment Drift Auditing Framework** by focusing on the stability and transferability of safety policies, a necessity for reliable, enterprise-scale AI.
